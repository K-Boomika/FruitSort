# Fruits Sorting Program
This Python program sorts a list of fruits based on their type and size. The fruits are represented in a grid, and the program uses a modified version of the A* search algorithm to find the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the fruits.

## Program Description
The program reads a list of fruits from a file. Each fruit has a type (represented by a letter) and a size (represented by a number). The list of fruits is represented as a grid.

The program sorts the fruits using a modified version of the A* search algorithm. The heuristic used by the algorithm is the Manhattan Distance between the current state and the goal state.

The goal state is generated by creating all possible permutations of the unique fruit types and sorting the fruits by type and size for each permutation. The program then finds the goal state that can be reached with the minimum number of swaps.

The program prints the minimum number of swaps needed to reach the goal state.

Usage
To run the program, use the following command:

> python FruitsSort.py FruitsArrangement1.txt
